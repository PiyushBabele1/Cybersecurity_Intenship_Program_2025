### Project-2: Dynamic Analysis in a Controlled Environment

## Introduction
Dynamic analysis involves executing malware in a controlled and isolated environment to observe its behavior. This approach allows you to monitor how the malware interacts with the system, such as file modifications, network communications, and changes to the registry. In this project, you will perform dynamic analysis on a simple malware sample to understand its operational characteristics.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of malware and its types.
- Familiarity with Windows operating system internals.
- Understanding of virtual machines and their configuration.

## Execution Setup:

- OS: Windows 11 VM
- Tools Used: Hybrid Analysis, ReaQta

## Behavior Observed:

- Primary Process: `jaga.exe`
- Spawned: `explorer.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wuapihost.exe`
- Injected into: `EB93A6J996E.exe`
- Mutexes used:
  - `Global\.net clr networking`, `ShimCacheMutex`, etc.

## Registry Manipulations
- Created:
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\International Business Machines Corp`
 - Tracing-related registry keys

- Deleted:
 - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\AuthRoot\Certificates\*`
 - `WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Tracing`

## Persistence Techniques

- `schtasks.exe` used to create and delete scheduled tasks
- Registry entries for autostart
- COM Hijacking for stealth loading

## Privilege & Anti-Analysis

- Uses `SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE` for process injection
- Evades sandboxes with sleep delays and deletes logs

## Summary
Dynamic analysis confirmed stealthy runtime behavior, privilege escalation via process injection, and solid persistence. The use of mutexes and log cleanup reveals advanced operational maturity.
