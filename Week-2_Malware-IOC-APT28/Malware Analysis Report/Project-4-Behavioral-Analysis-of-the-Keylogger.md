### Project-4: Behavioral Analysis of the Keylogger

## Introduction
Keyloggers are a type of malware that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information, such as passwords and personal messages. Understanding how keyloggers operate is crucial for detecting and mitigating their impact. In this project, you will analyze a keylogger sample to observe its behavior, including how it captures and stores keystrokes.

## Credential Theft Behaviors

- Targets:
  - Web Browsers
  - FTP Clients
  - Mail Applications
  - SSH Tools (Putty/Winscp)
  - Instant Messengers
- Harvests data from:
  - Registry Keys
  - Application config files

## Storage & Exfiltration

- Logs first stored at:
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\CLR_v2.0_32\UsageLogs\`
- Then sent to:
  - `hailmofset.com.tr` (IP: `185.150.128.28`)
- Communication over HTTPS

## Persistence & Evasion

- Registry: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- COM Hijacking: `T1546.015`
- Deletes its own scheduled tasks and log files after exfiltration
- Mutexes like `ShimCacheMutex` prevent reinfection

## Keystroke-Like Features

- While it doesn’t capture raw keystrokes into `.txt` files, it *acts as an advanced keylogger* by extracting credentials stored or typed into applications.

##Summary
The malware replicates keylogger functionality at a more advanced level—stealing credentials across services rather than recording every keystroke. Its stealth, registry-based persistence, and encrypted exfiltration elevate it beyond basic keyloggers.
