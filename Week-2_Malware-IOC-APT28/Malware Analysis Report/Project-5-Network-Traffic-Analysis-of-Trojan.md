### Project-5: Network Traffic Analysis of Trojan

## Introduction
A Trojan is a type of malware that often masquerades as legitimate software but performs malicious activities once executed. These activities frequently include communicating with a command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. Analyzing the network traffic generated by a Trojan can reveal its communication patterns and help identify malicious domains or IP addresses. In this project, you will analyze the network traffic of a Trojan to understand its communication mechanisms.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of malware and its types, particularly Trojans.
- Familiarity with networking concepts and protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
- Knowledge of network traffic analysis tools.

## C2 Communication Details

| Domain               | IP Address       | Purpose                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `hailmofset.com.tr`  | `185.150.128.28` | C2 data exfiltration over HTTPS |
| `checkip.dyndns.org` | `216.146.38.70`  | Public IP detection over HTTP   |

## Communication Traits

- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS
- Ports Used: `80`, `443`
- Encrypted Data Transfer: Yes (via HTTPS)
- IP Resolution via DNS queries
- Ingress tool transfer and proxy use observed

## MITRE Techniques Detected

- `T1071.001` – Web Protocols (HTTP/S)
- `T1573.001` – Encrypted Channel
- `T1568.002` – Domain Generation Algorithms
- `T1105` – Ingress Tool Transfer
- `T1090` – Proxy use
- `T1071.004` – DNS-based C2
- `T1571` – Non-Standard Port use

## Captured Traffic

- GET/POST requests with encrypted payloads
- Periodic beaconing to maintain C2 sync
- Transmission of stolen credentials and system info

## Data Types Exfiltrated

- System information (hostname, IP, locale)
- User credentials from browsers and apps
- Possibly screenshots and application logs

## Summary
The malware exhibits textbook Trojan behavior with strong, encrypted C2 communications, public IP detection, and data exfiltration to remote infrastructure. Its use of HTTPS, evasive beacons, and domain/IP shuffling ensures long-term undetected access.
