### Project-3: Analyzing the Ransomware

## Observation
No ransomware traits like file encryption, ransom note creation, or demand for payment were found.

## Why Itâ€™s Not Ransomware

- No Encryption Events: Procmon and Hybrid Analysis did not show encrypted file writes or renaming patterns.
- No Ransom Note: No `READ_ME.txt` or similar note creation observed.
- No Lock Screen Behavior: No GUI disruption or system lock.
- Main Focus: Credential theft and stealthy long-term access, not direct extortion.

## Summary
Although Gen:Variant.MSIL.Packy.1 uses tactics like registry manipulation and stealth, its goal is data theft, not file encryption or ransom demands. Thus, it is **not classified as ransomware.
