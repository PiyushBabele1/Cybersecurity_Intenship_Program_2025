### Project-1: Static Analysis of Gen:Variant.MSIL.Packy.1

## Introduction
Static analysis is the process of analyzing malware without executing it. This method involves examining the file's code and structure to gain insights into its functionality and behavior. In this project, you will perform static analysis on a simple malware sample using various tools to extract information such as strings, PE headers, imports/exports, and embedded resources.

## About the Malware
**Gen:Variant.MSIL.Packy.1** is not classified as ransomware, it’s typically a **Trojan/backdoor dropper** rather than encryption malware demanding ransom. This detection is a heuristic or generic label (e.g. from BitDefender, ESET, McAfee) indicating a suspicious .NET‑based executable that may act as a backdoor or downloader.

## Static Properties of Gen:Variant.MSIL.Packy.

- Type: `.NET PE32` GUI executable
- Size: 476 KB
- Hashes:
  - SHA-256: `c95be716c9b221cae2d6997a7eeb60436bcb5dd69ca9e8475b95a94abfe71fdd`
  - MD5: `7c0f36e996d94d01723372eda8309d81`
- Detected by 60/72 AV engines
- Packed with high-entropy sections

## Key Static Findings

- Registry keys created/modified for persistence:
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing`
- Credential-stealing code present (browser, FTP, SSH tools)
- Logs written at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\CLR_v2.0_32\UsageLogs\<hash>.unknown.exe.log`
- Deletion of `SystemCertificates\AuthRoot` to evade detection

## Summary
Static analysis showed that Gen:Variant.MSIL.Packy.1 is a credential-harvesting .NET Trojan packed to evade signature detection. It modifies multiple registry keys and hides logs, indicating premeditated stealth operations and long-term system compromise intent.
